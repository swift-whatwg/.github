# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Swift Institute packages.

## Maintainer

Swift Institute packages are currently maintained by Coen ten Thije Boonkkamp
as a sole-contributor project. Contributions via pull request are welcome; all
PRs are reviewed by the maintainer before merging.

## Conventions

Development conventions — naming, errors, memory safety, testing, modularization,
and more — are maintained internally and applied during code review. Open a PR
against the relevant repository; the maintainer will surface any convention
considerations during review.

## Before opening a pull request

- Follow the conventions in the relevant skill
- Every new type needs a test. Every bug fix needs a regression test
- No Foundation imports in Primitives or Standards packages — Foundation is a
  Foundations-layer concern
- Run `swift build` and `swift test` before submitting
